- [`wild-west`](wild-west/): default
- [`wild-west-pro`](wild-west-pro/): default with a `README` file
- [`drake-land`](drake-land/): small drake example
- [`drake-land-adv`](drake-land/): advanced drake for more complex folder structures (*work-in-progress*)

### Data used

The `data` in each folder is identical and was generated via [sinarueeger/create-data-workflow-example](https://github.com/sinarueeger/create-data-workflow-example/blob/master/opensnp-data.Rmd) and uses openSNP data from the [crowdAI challenge](https://zenodo.org/record/1442755#.W7TWFFJ9jUI).
